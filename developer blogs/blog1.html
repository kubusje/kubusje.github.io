        Dear readers,<br><br>

        Kubusje is expanding fast and so is the website. But how did it start?<br>
        Somewhere in april, 2019, Developer #1, had the idea to make a game. He wanted to make a game, but wasnâ€™t good at coding, so he came up with an easy, nice, fun game.<br><br>

        <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1DuHV01xGlYQr5KBSYHNfY15SFYWqgW0G">download version 1 for android here</a><br><br>

        It started with android games. Those were buggy and not good yet. The first windows version was created on the 24th of june, 2021. <br><br>

        <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1t5mB3frU8CFfEB9yc0zi-3Jio4pSp4V0">download first version for windows.</a><br><br>
        <!--[download first version for windows.]<br><br>-->

        Here was the game still called Kubesje the game.<br>
        Fun fact: Kubusje is translated from dutch to english: little cube. The whole name translated is: little cube, the game.<br>
        Today, we have expanded really fast. We now have 6 levels, language settings, tutorial video, replay button, and much more. <br><br>

        But we need your help. If you ever find a bug, or anything like that, contact us. This will make the game better for your experience and ours!<br><br>
